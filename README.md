# Restaurant Page

## Description

This page was created for learning purposes only. It is part of The Odin Project Curriculum. I made this page to learn how modules are implemented in Javascript. This web page uses Webpack, and everything (aside from a div with an id of content) was created dynamically with Javascript. Images were taken from Unsplash.com.

## Technologies Used

* Webpack
* Javascript
* HTML

## Features

List of features ready and TODOs for future development
